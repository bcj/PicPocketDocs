<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>One slight caveat to the above: PicPocket tasks check if a file exists at that location prior to writing but the check and the write are not atomic (they do not happen in a single file system call), so it is theoretically possible to overwrite a file that was created in between that check and PicPocket copying the file. As long as you aren’t running something else that is copying a bunch of files to conflicting locations at the same time, this won’t be a problem</p>

<h3>Source Path Formatting<a class="headerlink" href="#source-path-formatting" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>PicPocket provides some limited functionality for dynamically describing a source path.
This is done to make importing images from a device quicker (if you last imported from the device a day ago, there’s no point in it rechecking the 100 GB of photos you have in the 2010 folder). There are 6 special functions that exist, and they can be supplied by putting their name in angle brackets (e.g., <cite>directory/{year}/subdirectory</cite>). Only one special function can be given for a given directory in a path (i.e., <cite>directory/{year}{month}/subdirectory</cite> is not allowed).</p>
<p>When a task runs (and isn’t run with the ‘full’ flag), any date-based directories representing a date older than the last-run date (or, if you supply one, a custom date) will be skipped.</p>
<p>Custom Path Functions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>year</dt><dd><p>Will match against any directory name that looks like a year that isn’t older than the supplied year.</p>
<p>E.g., <cite>directory/{year}</cite> would ignore any images in <cite>directory/2022</cite> if the supplied date was January 1st 2023 or later. Even if no date was supplied, it would ignore <cite>directory/subdirectory</cite> as ‘subdirectory’ doesn’t look like a year</p>
</dd>
<dt>month</dt><dd><p>Will match against any directory name that looks like a month (currently only a number!). If ‘year’ has been supplied as well, then folders representing older dates than that year/month combo will be ignored.</p>
<p>E.g., <cite>directory/{year}/{month}</cite> would ignore any images in <cite>directory/2023/02</cite> unless the supplied date was February 28th, 2023 or earlier. If your directory structure has year as a subdirectory of month (e.g., <cite>directory/{month}/{year}</cite>) it will still work</p>
</dd>
<dt>day</dt><dd><p>Will match against any directory name that looks like a day (i.e., is a number between 1 and 31 inclusive, with or without leading 0). If ‘year’ and ‘month’ have been supplied as well, then folders representing older dates than that year/month/day combo will be ignored.</p>
<p>E.g., <cite>directory/{year}/{month}/{day}</cite> would ignore any images in <cite>directory/2023/02/28</cite> unless the supplied date was February 28th, 2023 or earlier. This will work for any arbitrary ordering of year/month/day (e.g., <cite>directory/{day}/{month}/{year}</cite>). If your images are stored in day/month/year format, you should message me to tell me about why that is most useful (tracking weather/star positions over years?). If your images are stored in some scrambled date format, I would be happier not knowing but I’m glad PicPocket can help.</p>
</dd>
<dt>date <strong>requires a supplied date format</strong></dt><dd><p>Will match against directories if they are in the correct date format and the date isn’t older than the supplied date.</p>
<p>Date formats are provided using Python’s <a class="reference external" href="https://strftime.org/">Strftime</a> date format, and are supplied after a colon (:) in the name.</p>
<p>E.g., <cite>directory/{date:%Y-%m-%dT%H%M}</cite> would ignore <cite>directory/2023-02-28T1623</cite> unless the supplied date was 4:23 PM on February 28th, 2023 or earlier.</p>
</dd>
<dt>regex <strong>requires a supplied pattern</strong></dt><dd><p>Will match against directories if they match a (Perl Compatible) <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions">Regular Expression</a>. Patterns are supplied after a colon (:) in the name.</p>
<p>E.g., <cite>directory/{regex:photo[s]?}</cite> would match against <cite>directory/photo</cite> and <cite>directory/photos</cite> and no other directories.</p>
</dd>
<dt>str <strong>requires supplied text</strong></dt><dd><p>If you want to tell a task to look in a directory with a <cite>{</cite> in it, PicPocket will assume you instead mistyped when trying to use any of the above special dynamic names. The str function is a way of passing that directory in a way that doesn’t confuse PicPocket.</p>
<p>E.g., <cite>directory/{str:{my directory{}</cite> will match against <cite>directory/{my directory{</cite></p>
</dd>

<section id="destination-path-formatting">
<h3>Destination Path Formatting<a class="headerlink" href="#destination-path-formatting" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>PicPocket also has some limited functionality for renaming files when copying them over.
This is done by supplied a path with any of the following placeholders:</p>
<dl>
<dt>directory</dt><dd><p>The directory the image was found in, relative to the source location root</p>
<p>E.g., if the source root is <cite>/Volumes/camera</cite> and the image is found at <cite>Volumes/camera/abc/2023/02/28/123.jpg</cite>, ‘directory’ will be <cite>abc/2023/02/28</cite></p>
</dd>
<dt>file</dt><dd><p>The name of the image file.</p>
<p>E.g., if the image is found at <cite>Volumes/camera/abc/2023/02/28/123.jpg</cite>, ‘file’ will be <cite>123.jpg</cite></p>
</dd>
<dt>name</dt><dd><p>The name of the image (without extension).</p>
<p>E.g., if the image is found at <cite>Volumes/camera/abc/2023/02/28/123.jpg</cite>, ‘name’ will be <cite>123</cite></p>
</dd>
<dt>extension</dt><dd><p>The image file suffix (without leading dot).</p>
<p>E.g., if the image is found at <cite>Volumes/camera/abc/2023/02/28/123.jpg</cite>, ‘extension’ will be <cite>jpg</cite></p>
</dd>
<dt>uuid</dt><dd><p>A UUID4 Hex (a hexadecimal number of the form <cite>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</cite>)</p>
</dd>
<dt>date</dt><dd><p>The last-modified date of the image in the <a class="reference external" href="https://strftime.org/">Strftime</a> date format of your choosing.</p>
<p>E.g., if the image was last modifed at 4:23 PM on February 28th, 2023, <cite>{date:%Y}</cite> would be <cite>2023</cite> and <cite>{date:%B %-d, %Y}</cite> would be <cite>February 28, 2023</cite></p>
</dd>
<dt>hash</dt><dd><p>A hexidecimal number representing the image’s contents that <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms#Comparison_of_SHA_functions">should</a> uniquely represent that image.</p>
<p>At present, the hash is a SHA-256 hash and will be 64 characters long. PicPocket reserves the right to modify this between versions</p>
</dd>
<dt>index</dt><dd><p>A 1-indexed number representing the order images are encountered by the task. PicPocket makes no promises about the order images are added in</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
</section>
<section id="running-tasks">
<h2>Running Tasks<a class="headerlink" href="#running-tasks" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>By default, PicPocket tasks will only attempt to copy images with last-modified dates that are newer than the time the task last ran.</p>
<p>You can manually supply an older or newer date to manually set the cutoff, or pass the ‘full’ flag to ignore last-modified date.</p>
<p>PicPocket doesn’t look at the modified dates of directories, as they do not tend to accurately reflect changes in further subdirectories.</p>
